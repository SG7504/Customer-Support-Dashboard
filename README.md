## 🌐 Project Overview

This project includes three core components:
- **Sidebar** (`sidebar.html`) — Provides navigation to support sections.
- **Main Content Area** (`main.html`) — Serves as the landing space for content loaded via links.
- **Tickets Page** (`tickets.html`) — Displays and manages support ticket information.

Each component is styled using a modern, dark-themed UI and can be displayed together using `iframe` or an HTML frameset.
