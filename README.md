# 🛠️ Customer Support Dashboard

A simple, clean, and responsive HTML5-based Customer Support Dashboard, ideal for use in internal tools or educational projects. Built using semantic HTML5 with modern styling practices.

## 🌐 Project Overview

This project includes a modular layout comprising:
- **Header** (`header.html`) — Displays a bold, themed title for the dashboard.
- **Sidebar** (`sidebar.html`) — Navigational panel with links to different support resources.
- **Main Content Area** (`tickets.html`) — Section where users can view and manage their support tickets.

The layout emphasizes readability, modern aesthetics (dark mode), and beginner-friendly structure.

└── tickets.html # Main content page for ticket management


## 🎯 Features

- Semantic and clean HTML5

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the HTML files in a web browser.
3. Use `iframe` or HTML frameset (if combining) to load the `header.html`, `sidebar.html`, and `tickets.html` together in one layout.
